# NetEX Validator Enhancement TODO

Based on analysis of the GTFS validator architecture, here are key improvements to implement:

## 1. Replace Error System with Notice Pattern

**Current:** `ValidationReportEntry[]` with basic error collection
**Goal:** Implement GTFS validator's `NoticeContainer` system

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `notice/` package with:
  - [ ] `Notice` interface (code, severity, context)
  - [ ] `NoticeContainer` for thread-safe collection
  - [ ] Notice limits per type to prevent spam
  - [ ] Severity-based filtering and statistics
- [ ] Replace `ValidationReportEntry` usage throughout codebase
- [ ] Add actionable error descriptions with fix suggestions
- [ ] Implement notice aggregation and better reporting

**Benefits:** Better error management, prevents spam, actionable feedback

## 2. Multi-Mode Validation System

**Current:** Single validation approach for all use cases
**Goal:** Three validation modes for different performance needs

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add validation mode enum: `Fast`, `Standard`, `Thorough`
- [ ] Restructure rule execution based on mode:
  - [ ] Fast: Schema + critical rules only (~30 rules, <2s)
  - [ ] Standard: Current full validation (~200 rules)
  - [ ] Thorough: Extended + quality rules (~300 rules)
- [ ] Update CLI with `--mode` flag
- [ ] Modify validator runner to filter rules by mode

**Benefits:** API-friendly fast mode, comprehensive analysis when needed

## 3. Enhanced Parallel Processing

**Current:** Basic goroutine parallelization
**Goal:** Configurable worker pool system

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create worker pool for ZIP file processing
- [ ] Add streaming processing for large files
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for repeated operations
- [ ] Add cancellation and timeout support
- [ ] Configurable worker count based on CPU cores

**Benefits:** Better resource management, handles large datasets efficiently

## 4. Rule Organization by Validation Depth

**Current:** Flat rule structure
**Goal:** Hierarchical rule organization

### Tasks:
- [ ] Reorganize rules into validation levels:
  - [ ] **Core**: Schema, structure, mandatory elements
  - [ ] **Business**: Nordic NeTEx Profile rules
  - [ ] **Quality**: Performance and data quality suggestions
- [ ] Update rule loading to support mode-based filtering
- [ ] Maintain existing XPath rule execution engine
- [ ] Add rule metadata for categorization

**Benefits:** Clear rule hierarchy, mode-based rule selection

## 5. CLI and User Experience Improvements

**Current:** Basic CLI with limited feedback
**Goal:** Enhanced user experience

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long validations
- [ ] Implement validation mode selection
- [ ] Add summary statistics in output
- [ ] Better error aggregation in reports
- [ ] Add validation timing and performance metrics

**Benefits:** Better user feedback, clear performance insights

## 6. Memory and Performance Optimizations

**Current:** Standard memory usage patterns
**Goal:** Memory-efficient processing

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement object pooling for frequent allocations
- [ ] Add streaming XML processing for large files
- [ ] Optimize memory usage during ZIP processing
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and limits
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for rule sets

**Benefits:** Lower memory footprint, handles larger datasets

## 7. Enhanced Reporting and Output

**Current:** Basic JSON/HTML output
**Goal:** Rich, actionable reporting

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add notice grouping and filtering in reports
- [ ] Implement interactive HTML reports with collapsible sections
- [ ] Add validation summary with key metrics
- [ ] Include fix suggestions in error descriptions
- [ ] Add rule coverage reporting

**Benefits:** More useful reports, actionable feedback

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority:** Notice System (#1) - Core improvement affecting all validation
2. **High Priority:** Multi-Mode System (#2) - Major user experience improvement  
3. **Medium Priority:** Enhanced Parallel Processing (#3) - Performance improvement
4. **Medium Priority:** Rule Organization (#4) - Foundation for other improvements
5. **Low Priority:** CLI Improvements (#5) - User experience polish
6. **Low Priority:** Memory Optimizations (#6) - Performance edge cases
7. **Low Priority:** Enhanced Reporting (#7) - Output quality improvements

## Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Keep NetEX-specific validation logic unchanged
- Focus on architecture improvements, not validation rule changes
- Ensure thread safety for all new components
- Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
